# Accurate Solution of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation via Multiple-Relaxation ImEx Methods
## Authors: Abhijit Biswas and David Ketcheson

#### This repository contains all the code used to generate the figures and tables in the manuscript 'Accurate Solution of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation via Conservative Multiple-Relaxation ImEx Methods.'
#### Once you have cloned the repository, you will find four folders containing codes:
- The folder named 'NLS_Multi_Soliton_FEM_Two_Inv' contains all the code necessary to generate figures 7, 8, and 9, as well as the data for table 5 in the manuscript. To produce the data, run the notebook 'ComputeSolHerbstNLS.ipynb,' and to generate the figures and table data, run the notebook 'PlotNumResultsHerbstNLS.ipynb.' The code provides parameters for different soliton solutions.
- Run the notebook 'One_Inv_SP_ImEx_TS.ipynb' from the folder 'NLS_Multi_Soliton_SP_One_Inv' to generate Figure 1 and the data for Table 2.
- Figures 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as the data for Tables 3 and 4, are generated by the code in the folder 'NLS_Semiclassical_SP_One_Inv.'
- Figure 6 is generated by running the notebook 'Plot_Time_Deriv_NLS_FEM_ODE_Sys_Inv.ipynb' in the folder 'Time_Derivative_Discrete_Inv.

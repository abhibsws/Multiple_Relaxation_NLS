# Accurate Solution of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation via Multiple-Relaxation ImEx Methods
## Authors: Abhijit Biswas and David Ketcheson

#### This repository contains all the code used to generate the figures and tables in the manuscript 'Accurate Solution of the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation via Multiple-Relaxation ImEx Methods.'
#### Once you have cloned the repository, you will find four folders containing codes:
## 'NLS_Multi_Soliton_FEM_Two_Inv/'
The folder named 'NLS_Multi_Soliton_FEM_Two_Inv' contains all the code necessary to produce figures 7, 8, and 9, as well as the data for table 5 in the manuscript. These codes implement finite element discretization in space and various ImEx methods, both with and without relaxation, to conserve two nonlinear invariants. You can run one of the notebooks to generate the data and another notebook to plot and generate all the figures and data for the table. There are two multi-soliton solution cases, and users can choose parameter values from the code to generate numerical results for different scenarios.
